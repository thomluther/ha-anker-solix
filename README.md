This Home Assistant custom integration utilizes the [anker-solix Python library][anker-solix-api], allowing seamless integration with Anker Solix devices via the Anker power cloud. It was specifically developed to monitor the Anker Solarbank E1600. Support for further Anker devices like solar micro-inverters (MI80), Solarbank 2 E1600, Solarbank 3 E2700 and Anker smart meters has been added to the Api library and is available through the integration. The Anker power cloud also supports portable power stations (PPS), home Power Panels or home energy systems (HES) which are not or only partially supported by the api library. They may be added in the future once Api data structures for those devices are known and regular consumption data will be sent to the Anker Power cloud.

> [!NOTE]
> Anker power devices which are not configured into a power system in your Anker mobile app typically do **NOT** provide any consumption data to the Anker power cloud. Likewise it has turned out, that portable power stations (PPS), power banks or power cooler do not send data to the Anker power cloud either since they are not configurable as a main power system device.Therefore, the Api library cannot get consumption data of standalone devices.

Please refer to [supported sensors and devices](#supported-sensors-and-devices) for a list of supported Anker Solix devices.

## Anker Account Information

Because of the way the Anker Solix Cloud Api was working, one account with email/password could not be used for the Anker mobile app and this Api in parallel.
The Anker Solix Cloud allowed only one login token per account at any time. Each new login request by a client will create a new token and the previous token on the server was dropped. For that reason, it was not possible to use this Api client and your mobile app with the same account in parallel. Starting with Anker mobile app release 2.0, you could share your owned system(s) with 'family members'. Since then it was possible to create a second Anker account with a different email address and share your owned system(s) with one or more secondary accounts as member.

> [!NOTE]
> System members cannot manage any devices of the shared system or view any device details. You can only see the system overview in the app. Likewise you have the same behavior when using the Api: You cannot query device details with the shared account because you don't have the required permissions for this data. However, a shared account is sufficient to monitor the overview values through the integration without being restricted for using the main account in the Anker app to manage your device settings if needed.

> [!TIP]
> Starting end of July 2025 and with version 3.10 of the Anker mobile app, one account can now be used across multiple devices in parallel. That means active login tokens are no longer deleted upon login of another client and parallel account usage becomes possible. Actually there is **NO NEED ANYMORE** to create a second account and share the system with it, since the main account can now be used in parallel across multiple devices and clients. To switch your account, refer to [Switching between different Anker Power accounts](#switching-between-different-anker-power-accounts)

For detailed usage instructions, please refer to the [INFO](INFO.md)


## Limitations

- The used Api library is by no means an official Api and is very limited as there is no documentation at all
- The Api library or the login can break at any time, or Api requests can be removed/added/changed and break some of the endpoint methods used in the underlying Api library
- The Api library was validated against both Anker cloud servers (EU and COM). Assignment of countries to either of the two servers however is unknown and depending on the selected country for your account. Upon wrong server assignment for your registered country, the Api may login but show no valid systems, devices or sensors in the integration
- The integration sensors and entities being provided depend on whether an Anker owner account or member account is used with the integration
- It was observed that solarbank or inverter devices may loose Wifi connection from time to time and will not be able to send data to the cloud. While device Wifi is disconnected, the reported data in the cloud may be stale. You can use the cloud state sensor of the end device to verify the device cloud connection state and recognize potentially stale data.
- The integration can support only Solix power devices which are defined in a power system via the Anker mobile app. While it may present also standalone devices that are not defined in a system, those standalone devices do not provide any usage or consumption data via the cloud Api and therefore will not present any power entities.
- Further devices which can be added to a power system and managed by the Anker Power cloud may be added in future once examples of Api response data can be provided to the developer.

> [!NOTE]
> To export randomized example data of your Anker power system configuration, please refer to the [anker-solix Python library][anker-solix-api] and the tool [export_system.py](https://github.com/thomluther/anker-solix-api#export_systempy). A new [HA service/action to export anonymized Api response data](INFO.md#export-systems-action) was added to the integration to simplify data collection in a downloadable zip file. You can open a new [issue as feature request](https://github.com/thomluther/ha-anker-solix/issues) and upload the zip file with the exported json files, together with a short description of your setup. Make sure to add your device to a power system via the Anker mobile app before exporting the configuration. Standalone devices will barely provide data through the cloud Api.

## Special device notes

### Standalone inverters (MI80)

Anker does not support the creation of a power system with their MI80 inverter as main and only device. However, the solar power and energy yields are still reported and tracked in the cloud and can be monitored in the mobile app. Version 2.7.0 added support for such standalone inverters. Even the persistent inverter limit can be changed via the cloud api. In order to merge entities for standalone inverters with the [common integration device hierarchy](https://github.com/thomluther/ha-anker-solix/discussions/239), a virtual system (site) will be created by the api library as home for the data polling and all entities that are typically related to a system device. The cloud update interval is approximately every 60 seconds if the inverter is online. The api however does a false reporting of the inverter Wifi state, which is always reported offline independent of its real Wifi state. The cloud connection state is a better indicator whether the inverter is On or Off. Since standalone inverters cannot be added to a real Anker power system, their monitoring cannot be shared with other accounts and their usage is limited to the Anker account that owns the device.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> It is assumed that any inverter limit change will be applied to persistent memory in the hardware. Write cycles are limited by the hardware, therefore it is **NOT recommended to modify the limit permanently** for any kind of output regulation. The limit change is currently not supported if the inverter is part of a solarbank system since the [api functionality still has to be verified by such system owners](https://github.com/thomluther/ha-anker-solix/discussions/255).


### Solarbank 1 devices

Solarbank 1 systems transfer their power values every 60 seconds to the cloud while there is PV generation or battery discharge. Once the Solarbank 1 goes into standby mode, there is only a cloud state check/update once per hour to save standby energy consumption.

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to use the output preset through the integration, you need to be aware of an Api bug that disables the export completely (set to 0 W) which is not possible via the Anker app at all. This occurs if the Api sends only a single slot (e.g. full day) in the schedule. This problem can only be fixed if you apply another plan change via the mobile app. To utilize the output preset without issues, you need to make sure that your schedule plan has at least 2 time slots.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The daily battery discharge statistic value for Solarbank 1 is no longer correct since mid June 2024. The cloud statistics changed this value when introducing support for Solarbank 2. The daily battery discharge value for Solarbank 1 now includes also bypassed PV energy, so its value is no longer dedicated to battery discharge only. You can see this wrong value also in your Anker app statistics for the Solarbank 1 battery.

### Solarbank 2 devices and Smart Meters

Anker changed the data transfer mechanism to the Api cloud with Solarbank 2 power systems. While Solarbank 1 systems transfer their power values every 60 seconds to the cloud, Solarbank 2 systems seem to use different intervals for their data updates to the cloud which is either 5 minutes or few seconds. Originally this resulted in **invalid data responses and unavailable entities** for shared accounts or api connections. This problem was resolved by Anker, but the regular cloud update interval remains at 5 minutes. Please see the [configuration option considerations for Solarbank 2 systems](INFO.md#option-considerations-for-solarbank-2-systems) in the [INFO](INFO.md) for more details and how you can avoid unavailable entities if this problem should occur again.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Any change of the control entities is typically applied immediately to Solarbank devices. However, since all Solarbank 2 devices have only a cloud update frequency of 5 minutes, it may take up to 6 minutes until you see the effect of an applied change in other integration entities (e.g. in various power sensors).


### Solarbank 2 AC devices

The Solarbank 2 AC model comes with new and unique features and initial support has been implemented with version 2.5.0. Version 2.6.0 added support for missing capabilities like modifications of the Time of Use plan via control entities or actions.

> [!NOTE]
> The Solarbank 2 AC devices still have issues and may stop updating some values in the cloud after active use of the mobile app with the system owner. See issue [#211](https://github.com/thomluther/ha-anker-solix/issues/211#issuecomment-2692936285).


### Combined Solarbank 2 systems containing cascaded Solarbank 1 devices

This coupling feature for 1st generation Solarbank devices was [announced in May 2024](https://www.ankersolix.com/de/blogs/balkonkraftwerk-mit-speicher/solarbank-der-ersten-generation-und-solarbank-2-pro-zusammen-fur-mehr-energiekontrolle) and [delivered in Dec 2024](https://www.ankersolix.com/de/blogs/balkonkraftwerk/die-1-generation-der-solarbank-vereint-sich-mit-dem-energiesystem-der-solarbank-2-pro-plus).
It turns out that Anker implemented just the bare minimum to support such combined systems. As users noticed, the power totals and energy statistics for such systems reflect ONLY the SB2 data, but not any SB1 data. That means you don't see anymore the SB1 solar power / energy during the day, but the SB1 discharge at night counts as solar power/energy of the SB2 during the night. All reported charge or discharge data does not reflect anything of the SB1 devices in the system. So the SB1 is pretty much a black box for the Anker home page and the energy statistics, which can also be accessed by system members.
Furthermore, the SB1 device(s) may have different schedules in combined systems. While the SB2 is running in an automatic mode, the SB1 has its own schedule with all known controls for any number of time intervals. When the SB2 is switched to manual mode however, it enforces another, minimalistic all day interval schedule to the SB1 devices which is not accessible via the mobile App. This schedule has no interval control elements. The output preset is the only value for the whole day interval and it is determined by the SB2, depending on its manual plan settings and SOC. When adding a SB1 device into a SB2 system, the 'Solarbank 2' will get configured as inverter type for the cascaded SB1 device. Therefore the output preset in this minimalistic schedule can also be 0 W for the SB1, however the 0 W output will only be applied if the 0 W output switch accessory is installed between SB1 output and SB2 input. Otherwise the SB1 will still bypass a minimum of 100 W typically. To prevent any SB1 schedule modifications while the enforced schedule is active, the integration will make all affected control entities unavailable to prevent user changes. Therefore you may see unavailable controls in cascaded SB1 devices that cannot be modified any longer, otherwise this may screw up the presented values and schedule settings, which would always be applied to the real SB1 schedule, even if inactive.
To present correct total values for the combined system, the Api library corrects also the solarbank totals in the Api system info response based on proper accumulation of individual solarbank device values:
  - Total solar power: SB1 device(s) solar power + SB2 device solar power - SB1 device(s) output power
  - Total output power: Remains SB2 device output power
  - Total SOC: Weighted average SOC across all devices, considering also number of SB2 battery packs
  - Total battery power:
    - The device battery power has always been calculated by the library, since the Api never reflected reliable charge or discharge power fields
    - It is calculated as Solar power - Output power, resulting in the overall battery power for the device (positive charge power and negative discharge)
    - Since a single device cannot charge and discharge at the same point in time, the device battery power typically reflects the complete charge OR discharge power
    - The total battery power simply accumulates each device's battery power, and thus reflecting the total NET battery power
    - However, this total NET battery power of multiple devices cannot reflect the total charge or discharge power at any given time, since a SB1 discharge of 100 W and a charge of those 100 W by the SB2 will result in 0 W NET battery power. So neither the 100 W charge power nor the 100 W discharge power are reflected in the total (NET) battery power value.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you derived your HA energy integral sensors or other helpers from a positive/negative value split of the system battery power, your charge and discharge energy calculations will not be accurate anymore in combined systems.

To achieve a correct charge and discharge energy calculation for your energy dashboard, you need to separate the charge and discharge power individually from each device battery power value. Then you can accumulate correct energies in following 2 ways:
  - Accumulate charge and discharge energy individually for each device and add them all to the energy dashboard. This allows granular energy tracking per Solarbank, since the dashboard will automatically accumulate energies of same type, but display each in a different color. This is the recommended option.
  - Create total charge and discharge power helper entities, that summarize the device power values separately. Then you can accumulate the total charge and discharge energies from those new summary helper entities.


### Solarbank 3 devices

Solarbank 3 devices behave similar to Solarbank 2 AC devices, but they will provide additional entities and usage mode options that are unique to this generation:
  - Anker Intelligence (AI) usage with 'Smart' mode
  - Dynamic Price support (Provider options depend on country and model)
  - New 'Time Slot' usage mode (based on dynamic prices) to automate AC charging and discharging
  - 24h solar forecast data while 'Smart' mode is active, which can be seen in the App intraday solar chart

However, it was noticed that the Solarbank charging status code is not longer being used by models that contain a hybrid inverter (since Solarbank 2 AC). The code remains always '0' which is translated into a `Detection` status as used by earlier solarbank models. Since that is no longer meaningful for Solarbank 2+ models, starting with version 3.2.0 an appropriate charging status description is assumed for code '0' of Solarbank 2+ devices, which is based on the actual power and SOC value constellation. A new description for AC charging was also implemented to better distinguish the various charging modes for hybrid inverter models.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Neither 'Smart' mode nor 'Time Slot' mode configuration options are provided in the known cloud Api structures. Therefore these new modes can only be toggled, but not configured or modified via the integration. If you want the toggle to these new modes, they must be configured initially through the mobile app. For example, the Smart mode requires your data usage authorization as well as confirmation of device location via Google Maps before it can be enabled.

[Dynamic utility rate plan support](INFO.md#dynamic-utility-rate-plans-options) was introduced with integration version 3.0.0. Version 3.1.0 added support for [solar forecast data](INFO.md#solar-forecast-data).

> [!NOTE]
> The Solarbank 3 dynamic price VAT and fee actually cannot be determined or modified through the cloud Api. While those entities can be customized in the integration, the changes are only applied as customization to the Api cache, but **NOT** to your real system configuration. However, they are required to calculate the total dynamic prices (actual and forecast) as used by your system to evaluate charge and discharge slots as well as saving calculations. To monitor total dynamic prices and forecast also as system member, those entities have been made customizable in the Api cache for now. They will be initialized with an average default for your country if defined. Refer to [customizable entities](INFO.md#customizable-entities-of-the-api-cache) for more details on their behavior.


### Solarbank Multisystem with Power Dock

Anker announced the [Solarbank Multisystem solution for early testing in Germany](https://www.ankersolix.com/de/balkonkraftwerk-mit-speicher/solarbank3-a17c5-multisystem) (DE) with common delivery planned in September 2025. A Solarbank Multisystem with the Power Dock will support up to 4 Solarbank devices. Initially this is only supported for Solarbank 3, but the various Solarbank 2 models are announced to follow end of 2025.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Actually there are significant consumption data update issues for such systems during the initial deployment phase and cloud values may be wrong or lagging hours behind. This becomes especially visible via the Api or the Anker mobile App once using a member account.

The Api library implemented enhancements to mask some value errors, but this can be done only on a limited base. It also does not help for proper total value breakdown to individual devices, if the breakdown is missing in the cloud data. Therefore some of the Solarbank device power values may reflect the appliance totals instead of individual breakdown.
Many settings for Multisystems are shared across all Solarbanks in the system, like usage mode, SOC reserve and export to grid setting. In the mobile App they are managed through the station settings, and the individual device settings are greyed out. Custom plans for output presets is shared for all devices, and the individual device output is managed automatically across all solarbanks, depending on their SOC, capacity etc. That means they cannot be modified individually anymore. The integration will still show the individual device settings if applicable, but changing them will change the settings for all devices in the system. The new combiner box device type will be used for the passive power dock, which is not reported as normal device by the cloud since it is passive and has no cloud connection. The integration will use it to reflect combined sensors and control entities for such Multisystems, although those values and settings are not managed by the combiner box itself.

> [!NOTE]
> The expected Multisystem support for Solarbank 2 devices or intermix required a new system type, that allows combining parallel and different SB2 types within a system. This may be reflected in different Api structures compared to SB3 Multisystems, and it is unclear whether the integration can support them with actual Multisystem enhancements.
> For more details on Multisystem support, please refer and contribute to issue [#310](https://github.com/thomluther/ha-anker-solix/issues/310)


### Electric Vehicle devices

Anker announced its [Solix V1 EV Charger](https://www.ankersolix.com/de/smart-ev-ladegeraet-solix-v1) (DE) which can be used as stand alone system or being integrated into the X1 HES system as well as into the Solarbank Multisystem (by 4Q 2025). The EV Charger device can be shared amongst Anker cloud users, while each user can define/create its own virtual electric vehicle, or even multiple of them (up to 5 vehicles per account). The vehicles are used to manage EV charging by individual users, even if they are not the owner of the system to which the EV Charger device belongs to. Each user will need to create its own vehicle(s) to create and manage charge orders for the V1. The integration currently does **NOT** yet support the vehicle creation itself, but it creates a virtual device for each existing EV under the user account and it can modify various vehicle attributes and show all entities that belong to the vehicle. The user vehicle can also be deleted by removing the vehicle device from the integration hub.

> [!TIP]
> The integration will automatically discover added and removed vehicles under the user account during the regular device details refresh cycle (10 minutes per default). An immediate vehicle refresh can also be triggered manually by a corresponding button of the account device.


### Power Panels

Power Panels are not supported in the EU market, therefore the EU cloud api server currently does not support either the required endpoints. Furthermore it was discovered that the F3800 power stations attached to the Power Panel are not tracked as system devices. Actual power consumption data in the cloud api was not discovered yet and it is assumed that the power panel home page consumption values are merged by the App from the MQTT cloud server only if the App home page is viewed. A work around for monitoring some power values and overall SOC has been implemented by extracting the last valid 5 minute average data that is collected with the system energy statistics (Basically the last data point that is visible in the various daily diagrams of your mobile app). However this comes with a **[cost of ~80 MB data traffic per system per day](https://github.com/thomluther/ha-anker-solix/discussions/32#discussioncomment-12748132)** just for the average power values. You can exclude the average power category from your integration configuration options to reduce they daily data traffic.

Integration version 3.1.0 added a [customizable battery capacity](INFO.md#battery-capacity) to the Powerpanel device. Since the assigned F3800 PPS cannot be determined via Api queries, the capacity is assumed with a single F3800 device without expansion batteries. You can adjust the capacity to your installation to let the integration calculate the estimated remaining battery energy based on the actual SOC. See [customizable entities](INFO.md#customizable-entities-of-the-api-cache) for a better understanding how such virtual entities are being used.

Power Panel owners need to explore and document cloud Api capabilities to further expand any Power Panel system or device support. Please refer to issue [Add F3800/BP3800 Equipment when connected to Home Power Panel](https://github.com/thomluther/anker-solix-api/issues/117) for contribution.


### Home Energy Systems (HES)

Anker released also large battery devices to complement existing PV systems. They are classified as Home Energy Systems (HES) and they come along with their own Api structures and endpoints. The X1 system belongs to this device category. The common HES Api structures and information is still unknown to a large extend, since most queries require owner access to such a device. Furthermore no endpoint to query actual power values has been identified yet, and it is assumed that the power values presented on the App home screen are merged from the MQTT server Api, but only when the App is actively used. In order to provide initial monitoring capabilities similar to Power Panel systems, the same work around for average power values and overall SOC has been implemented by extracting the last valid 5 minute average data that is collected with the system energy statistics (Basically the last data point that is visible in the various daily diagrams of your Anker App). However this comes with a **[cost of ~80 MB data traffic per system per day](https://github.com/thomluther/ha-anker-solix/discussions/32#discussioncomment-12748132)** just for the average power values. You can exclude the average power category from your integration configuration options to reduce they daily data traffic.

Since integration version 3.0.0, a customizable battery capacity entity was implemented for each X1 battery module. As described above, SOC and average power values are extracted from intraday energy stats of the whole system. The values are reported against the main controller device in your system. Likewise this controller device has now also a virtual and customizable capacity entity for the whole system. If you adjust the capacity of individual battery modules, this is considered automatically for the overall system capacity calculation. However, if you modify the overall system capacity in the main controller device, individual capacity modifications of battery modules are ignored.

Integration version 3.1.0 added [Dynamic utility rate plan support](INFO.md#dynamic-utility-rate-plans-options) to monitor dynamic price forecasts for your system. However, none of those entities can actually control your X1 system settings, they are only used as [customizable entities](INFO.md#customizable-entities-of-the-api-cache) to calculate the total energy price.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> I have not seen any data of X1 systems that have more than 1 controller device (I think there can be up to 3 ðŸ¤”). Therefore I have no clue how SOC and average power entities are reported across multiple controller devices in the system. They may be created as duplicates for each controller and also the system capacity calculation may be completely wrong. Please open an issue and export your X1 system data if you have such an installation and weird entity constellations.

X1 system owners need to explore and document cloud Api capabilities to further expand any X1 system or (sub-)device support. Please refer to issue [Extending the solution to support Anker Solix X1 systems](https://github.com/thomluther/anker-solix-api/issues/162) for contribution or create a new and more specific issue as feature request.


### Other devices

Other devices not listed in the support table are neither supported nor tested with the Api library or the HA integration. Be aware that devices are only supported by the Anker cloud Api if they can be added into a Power System. Stand alone devices such as portable power stations (PPS), power charger or power cooler, cannot be added to a system and therefore do not provide any data into the power cloud.

To get additional Anker power devices/systems added, please review the [anker-solix Python library][anker-solix-api] and contribute to [open issues](https://github.com/thomluther/anker-solix-api/issues) or Api exploration. Most devices can neither be tested by the developer, nor can they be added to the HA integration before their Api usage, parameters, structures and fields are fully understood, interpreted and implemented into the Api library.
You can also explore the Anker Solix cloud Api directly within your HA instance via the integration's [Api request action](INFO.md#api-request-action).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> While the integration may show standalone devices that you can manage with your Anker account, the cloud Api used by the integration does **NOT** contain or receive power values or much other details from standalone devices which are not defined to a Power System. The realtime data that you see in the mobile app under device details are either provided through the local Bluetooth interface or through an MQTT cloud server, where all your devices report their realtime values but only for the time they are triggered by an owner account in the App. Such data can only be integrated via an optional MQTT client session.


## MQTT data from devices

The [Api library version 3.3.0](https://github.com/thomluther/anker-solix-api/releases/tag/v3.3.0) added support for an optional MQTT client session with the Anker MQTT server. Based on the MQTT server access information available from your Api connection, an MQTT client session can be connected to the MQTT server and subscribe to root topics for your owned devices and receive their MQTT published messages. All devices that you configured via your mobile App send data to the MQTT server at different intervals, depending on device type and state (3 sec - hourly). The Api cloud servers are also subscribed to the MQTT server in order to receive your individual device data, and record energy statistics or calculate other values that are relevant to your power system. The regular data publish interval may be in the range of 1-5 minutes, but real time data publish (3-5 seconds) can be triggered via the MQTT server for a certain timeout duration. This mechanism is used by the mobile App, which typically triggers real time data publish for a timeout duration of 5 minutes once you access the home screen or device details pages. After the timeout, the devices fallback to their standard publish interval. This trigger is only possible for owned devices, therefore member accounts typically do not see frequent data updates on the App home screen, but only at default publish intervals. Likewise the HA integration cannot get or trigger more frequent data updates via the Api connection.
The optional MQTT session however can also trigger the real time date publish for owned devices. However, this mechanism is not designed to run 24x7, especially not if devices are supposed to go into standby mode. Beside additional power consumption, it may also cause lots of additional data traffic! Not only for your local MQTT client, but also in the backend between MQTT and Cloud servers.
While the cloud Api payload is typically encrypted, the published MQTT message payload from the devices is not encrypted. But the bad news is, the payload is proprietary binary data, which is different for each device type and device constellation. The good news is, that the general MQTT data structure has been identified. The MQTT and Bluetooth data structures seem to be pretty identical. This enables byte decoding capabilities for the reported MQTT data fields.

This is were YOUR contribution is required. Decoding of Anker MQTT binary data has been made as simple as possible and an [mqtt_monitor tool](https://github.com/thomluther/anker-solix-api#mqtt_monitorpy) is available with the [Api library](https://github.com/thomluther/anker-solix-api). To get started, follow the [MQTT data decoding guidelines](https://github.com/thomluther/anker-solix-api/discussions/222).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Nothing of the Anker MQTT server connection or data will be used by the HA integration for the time being. There is still significant development required in the Api library as well as the HA integration to utilize any MQTT data and merge values with existing cloud Api data in a useful way. Furthermore, most device MQTT data structures still have to be decoded and documented by the community, so that byte fields can be mapped to correct values and names for utilization in the Api cache structures.


## Installation via HACS (recommended)

ðŸŽ‰ The repository has been added to HACS community store ðŸŽ‰

You should find the Anker Solix integration when you search for Anker Solix in HACS and you can install it directly from your HACS store.

Unfortunately, HACS does not automatically install the optional entity images that must be located within the web accessible `www` folder, which must be located in your HA installation configuration folder. Please see [Optional entity pictures](#optional-entity-pictures) for instructions to copy the image files manually.

If you don't find the integration in your HACS store, use this button to add the repository to your HACS custom repositories:

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open a repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.][hacs-repo-badge]][hacs-install]

Or use following procedure for HACS 2.0 or later to add the custom repository:
1. Open the [HACS](https://hacs.xyz) panel in your Home Assistant frontend.
1. Click the three dots in the top-right corner and select "Custom Repositories."
1. Add a new custom repository via the Popup dialog:
   - **Repository URL:** `https://github.com/thomluther/ha-anker-solix`
   - **Type:** Integration
1. Click "Add" and verify that the `Anker Solix` repository was added to the list.
1. Close the Popup dialog and verify that `Anker Solix` integration is now listed in the Home Assistant Community Store.
1. Install the integration


### Installation Notes

- It was observed that adding the repository to HACS via the button, an error may occur although it was added. You may check if you can find Anker Solix listed as possible HACS integration to be installed. If not, try to add the repository again.
- After adding the custom repository and installing the integration under HACS, you must restart Home Assistant to pick up the changes in your custom integration folder
   - HA 2024.02 will report the required restart automatically under problems
- After HA restart, you can install and configure the integration like a normal core integration via the HA frontend:
   - Go to "Configuration" -> "Integrations" click "+" and search for "Anker Solix". It should now be listed as community integration


## Manual Installation

1. Using the tool of choice to open the directory (folder) for your HA configuration (where your `configuration.yaml` is located, e.g. `/homeassistant`)
1. If you do not have a `custom_components` directory (folder) there, you need to create it
1. In the `custom_components` directory (folder) create a new folder called `anker_solix`
1. Download _all_ the files from the `custom_components/anker_solix/` directory (folder) in this repository
1. Place the files you downloaded in the new directory (folder) you created
1. Restart Home Assistant
1. In the HA UI go to "Configuration" -> "Integrations" click "+" and search for "Anker Solix"


## Optional entity pictures

If you want to use the optional entity pictures that are shown in the example screenshots in the [INFO](INFO.md), you need to copy the `images` folder from the integration installation path to the `www` folder of your Home Assistant installation configuration folder. If you operate a Home Assistant OS device, you can preferably use file management Add Ons such as Studio Code Server or File Explorer to copy this folder after the installation:
1. Navigate to the configuration folder of your HA installation (where your `configuration.yaml` is located, e.g. `/homeassistant`)
1. Navigate to `custom_components/anker_solix/` folder and copy the `images` subfolder containing the entity pictures
1. Go back to your configuration folder and navigate to or create the `www/community/anker_solix` folder structure if not existing
1. Paste the `images` folder into the created `anker_solix` community subfolder

 Once the images are available in `www/community/anker_solix/images/`, they will be picked up when the integration is (re-)creating the entities, like on first creation or re-load of the configuration entry.  Make sure to reload your HA UI browser window without cache to get the entity pictures displayed correctly.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you just created the `www` folder on your HA instance, it is not mapped yet to the `/local` folder and cannot be accessed through the browser. You have to restart your HA instance to have the new `www` folder mapped to `/local` and allow the entity pictures to be displayed.


## Integration configuration and usage

For detailed instructions on how to configure and use the integration, please refer to [INFO](INFO.md).

Note: When you make changes to the integration folder content, you need to restart Home Assistant to pick up those changes for the container or virtual environment where Home Assistant is being started. This is applicable as well when the integration is updated manually or via HACS.


## Issues, Q&A and other discussions

If you have a problem, [review existing issues or open a new issue](https://github.com/thomluther/ha-anker-solix/issues) with detailed instructions describing the problem. You may need to enable Debug Output for your Integration configuration. Review your debug output before you post it. While sensitive login information is masked, your unique device information as returned from the Api is not masked (serial numbers, IDs etc). You may want to change that globally before providing a debug output.
